8923,"(CNN)Pope Francis risked Turkish anger on Sunday by using the word ""genocide"" to refer to the mass killings of Armenians a century ago under the Ottoman Empire. ""In the past century, our human family has lived through three massive and unprecedented tragedies,"" the Pope said at a Mass at St. Peter's Basilica to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Armenian massacres. ""The first, which is widely considered 'the first genocide of the 20th century,' struck your own Armenian people,"" he said, referencing a 2001 declaration by Pope John Paul II and the head of the Armenian church. His use of the term genocide -- even though he was quoting from the declaration -- upset Turkey. The nation recalled its ambassador to the Vatican for ""consultations"" just hours after Francis' comments, the Turkish Foreign Ministry said. Earlier, Turkey summoned the ambassador from the Vatican for a meeting, Turkish state broadcaster TRT reported. Turkey's former ambassador to the Vatican, Kenan Gursoy, told CNN in a telephone interview that while it is the first time Turkey has summoned its ambassador home from the Vatican, ""This does not mean that our diplomatic ties with the Vatican are over."" ""Since this is a situation that we do not approve of, as a first reaction, (the ambassador) is summoned to get consultation,"" Gursoy said, adding that the Pope's use of the word ""genocide"" was ""a one-sided evaluation."" In a tweet Sunday on his official account, Turkey's Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu called the Pope's use of the word ""unacceptable"" and ""out of touch with both historical facts and legal basis."" ""Religious offices are not places through which hatred and animosity are fueled by unfounded allegations,"" the tweet reads. This consternation over the use of the word 'genocide' occurs regularly. And Armenians are equally upset, when Turkey protests it. Armenian Foreign Minister Edward Nalbandian rebuked Turkey. ""We are in a situation in which Turkey speaks a different language from the rest of the international community and it seems that it doesn't understand that it is speaking a different language,"" he said to Italian News Agency Adnkronos. ""During these past days there have been several international organizations that adopt resolutions or issue statements that recognize the Armenian genocide and that appeal to Turkey to make this step,"" he said. ""The Pope's statement are in this context of universal value. When Turkey is able to understand this, it will be able to understand what the International community and big personalities (or better translations 'leaders') are saying."" Armenian groups and many scholars say that Turks planned and carried out genocide, starting in 1915, when more than a million ethnic Armenians were massacred in the final years of the Ottoman Empire. Turkey officially denies that a genocide took place, saying hundreds of thousands of Armenian Christians and Turkish Muslims died in intercommunal violence around the bloody battlefields of World War I. The Armenian government and influential Armenian diaspora groups have urged countries around the world to formally label the 1915 events as genocide. Turkey has responded with pressure of its own against such moves. Pope Francis said Sunday that ""Catholic and Orthodox Syrians, Assyrians, Chaldeans and Greeks"" were also killed in the bloodshed a century ago. He said Nazism and Stalinism were responsible for the other two ""massive and unprecedented tragedies"" of the past century. CNN's Gul Tuysuz in Turkey, Nimet Kirac and Karen Smith in Atlanta contributed to this report.","Former Turkish ambassador to the Vatican calls use of the word ""genocide"" a ""one-sided evaluation""

5133,"Chilean pickpockets have become the most effective thieves operating in central London, according to undercover police teams. Gangs of up to six follow wealthy shoppers in the West End before stealing their cash and belongings, according to the plain-clothes officers tasked with reducing theft in the area. In one example Metropolitan Police stopped two Chilean women wearing burkas after they had been spotted targeting rich Arab tourists in the Park Lane and Mayfair areas. Chilean pickpockets have become the most effective thieves operating in central London, according to undercover police teams . A bag they were carrying contained €130,000 and £20,000 as well as gold and diamond jewellery. London's busy shopping areas prove a big draw for gangs of pickpockets from around the world including Romania, Algeria and Bulgaria, reports Andy Jones on Vice. But DC Darren Bond, whose team monitors the Oxford Street, Bond Street and Regent Street areas, explained to the the website that Chilean pickpockets 'don't mess about'. He is quoted as saying: 'They are intelligence-led – they don't go after anyone but wealthy tourists – and operate in mixed teams of three to six, often middle-aged. 'They will look like a nice family or group of businessmen to fit in. It allows them to walk through hotels unchallenged, sit down and have breakfast, then walk out with bags, laptops, etc. They are so hard to trace.' Plain clothes police are attempting to drive down pickpocket crimes in busy shopping areas like Oxford Street, pictured . He said many arrive in Britain on a six-month VISA before heading off on a 'European tour' and police are constantly monitoring CCTV to keep tabs on  gangs and their recruits. Organised international gangs of thieves will often spend a short time operating in London before flying to the likes of Madrid, Barcelona and Milan for the same purpose - all as part of moves to avoid detection. DC Bond, whose squad has seen a 50 per cent reduction in thefts over the last year, told Vice that 'anecdotally' about 70 per cent of arrested pickpockets were Romanians or Bulgarians, ten per cent Algerians and five per cent Chileans with the rest UK-based. 'Big city theft is now organised, international crime with bosses and a hierarchy,' he added.","Gangs of South Americans target shoppers in West End, police have said ."
10793,"The nation has yet to hear the first words of Prince George. But thanks to new puppet show Newzoids, we can at least get a version of them. In true satirical style, the 20-month-old has been cast as a blinged-up rascal with a tattoo on his arm. Teasers for the ITV programme – which starts tonight at 9pm – show the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge worrying that their son has turned out a little, well, common. Scroll down for video . 'Rascal': A new satire puppet show sees Prince George 'blinged-up' with a tattoo, addressing a female doctor with 'Oi, oi! Hello treacle' A doctor is called to assess his condition and the young prince bounces on screen with a big, gold ‘G’ pendant around his neck. The youngster says to the waiting female doctor ‘Oi, oi! Hello treacle. Is that a ladder in your tights or a stairway to heaven?’ before proceeding to smack her on the bottom. The plotline plays off newspaper headlines which dubbed his mother Kate the Commoner. Debra Stephenson, one of the show’s impressionists, admitted that mocking the royal family is a daunting task. ‘It feels extremely mischievous doing all those voices but it is done for fun. I don't know how it would be received. It's a very daunting thought,’ she told the Daily Mail. Teasers for ITVs new puppet show sees the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge worrying that their son has turned out a little 'common' 'Daunting task': Newzoids starts Wednesday at 9pm and kicks off by making fun of the Royal Family . Big brother: Prince George could be days away of becoming an older brother as the Duchess is due to give birth to her second child 'mid- to late April' ‘You try and pass it off and think “Oh, they won’t possibly watch it” but there is always the worry that someone will be shown a clip on YouTube or something.’ Of the Prince George skit, she said: ‘I like it because it is so surreal. The papers have dubbed Kate 'Kate the Commoner' but she is clearly not common in any way. 'But the idea is quite funny, the idea she could have this throwback gene to something like this.’ Another of the show’s impressionists, Jon Culshaw, best known for Dead Ringers, added: ‘It was an idea that chimed with the writers to have Prince George as a bit of a rascal who runs around saying “Oi, oi!”. It’s an absurd and funny extreme.’ Prince George and his parents will be joined on screen by the Queen, Prince Harry and the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall in a series of sketches titled Mrs Crown’s Boys. Other famous faces on the Newzoids roll call are Ant and Dec, Wayne Rooney, Beyonce, Harry Styles, David Cameron, Ed Miliband, Nick Clegg, Barack Obama, Russell Brand and Simon Cowell.","Satire puppet show depicts Prince George as a 'blinged-up rascal'

11326,"Sandra Garratt was in constant agony after undergoing two operations before her death . A grandmother racked with constant pain jumped from the top of a multi-storey car park to end her suffering, her devastated husband has said. Sandra Garratt, 56, went through two years of agony following two back operations for a slipped disc and not even morphine could dull the pain. Last month doctors told the housewife there was nothing more they could do ease her suffering and this was the 'final straw', according to her husband Steve.

At 2.35pm, police and ambulance crews were called to the Cornbow Shopping Centre in Halesowen, where they discovered Mrs Garratt's body. She had fallen more than 50ft from the top of an Asda supermarket multi-storey car park. Mr Garratt, 57, told how he gave up his job as a community transport driver last year to care for his wife. He said her suffering had intensified in the last 18 months of her life and the pain had spread to her legs, feet and fingers. He added: 'She was in pain every minute of every day. She was a happy lovely person but withdrew from her happy family life. 'Before there had been hope but when there was nothing they could do, it was the final straw. 'Everybody says the same – she is now free from the pain. That's the only bit of comfort. 'The doctors and GPs, within the scope of the NHS waiting lists and everything that goes on, did everything they could.'

The catwalk was replaced with a tennis court, the front row with stadium seating, and the usual parade of slender models walking single file was nowhere in sight. Instead, four strong, muscular women sashayed onto the grass, and proceeded to stretch and bend their bodies into yoga poses. Lindy Klim, along with former Commonwealth Games pole vaulter Amanda Bisk, Australian Ballet star Juliette Burnett, and Yogi and Instagram star Sjana Earp, wowed the crowds as they struck strong poses.

Lindy Klim was excited to be returning to the 'catwalk' for the first time in nine years, and since becoming a mother. The beautiful 37-year-old said she wasn't nervous despite being absent from the runway in nearly a decade, and the age difference between herself and the other participants. 'I’m quite comfortable with myself. I’m older than most girls here but 'I'm quite comfortable with my body and exercise a lot so it’s a good fit,' she said, adding that the We Are Handsome message aligned with her health and fitness philosophies. Fashion Week star Samantha Harris was one of the few 'traditional' models in the show . Athletic: The brand emphasised strong fitness-focused women above traditional runway models . Klim told DMA that there is a start contrast in her fitness and diet habits when she is in Australia versus her life at home in Bali. 'I exercise in Bali for two hours a day, but then when I'm in Australia I don't exercise at all,' she revealed, adding that in Australia she struggles to find the time in her schedule. 'My diet in Bali is a lot healthier in Bali than it is in Australia. It's so much easier to eat really healthy food there, it's all organic, locally grown food. 'We don't snack in Bali either - we don't have chips and lollies and things, so I find it a lot easier to eat over there. 'When I'm in Australia I love to go out to restaurants, drink red wine, and i do that a lot during Fashion Week as well as its so social.'

69,"In a sport so often dominated by egos, the idiom ‘if he was chocolate, he’d eat himself’ could be used on a weekly basis in boxing. And going by the sobriquet ‘Kid Chocolate’, you might expect Peter Quillin to have an appetite to match his ring alias. Instead, the man who will stand in the opposite corner to Limerick’s Andy Lee next weekend comes across as anything but the egotist. Peter Quillin (left) may be nicknamed 'Kid Chocolate' but he shows none of the expected arrogance . At times, the 31-year-old’s verbal patter buzzes with a modesty and philosophical slant which often betrays the expectations of a hard-hitting middleweight, carrying a 71 per-cent knockout rate in his undefeated record. Only once during the course of an exclusive interview with Sporstmail does Quillin speak with a hint of bite to match the aggression that saw him put Hassan N’Dam N’Jikam on the canvas six times en route to his 2012 world-title win. This comes when he is questioned about the criticism he received after opting to vacate his WBO world championship last year. While Lee is the defending champion next weekend, Quillin, the challenger, is also the former title holder having never lost the belt in the ring. The 31-year-old had been due to defend against undefeated Russian Matt Korobov but turned down a career-best $1.4million pay day when deciding not to fight the mandatory challenger. Lee later stepped in to defeat the Russian (for a much lower purse), leaving Quillin to face accusations of ‘ducking’ his obligations as champion. Only recently did Quillin reveal that he took a sabbatical to deal with the conflicting emotions of welcoming his first child into the world, while seeing his uncle unsuccessfully battle cancer. ‘I learned a lot of patience through that, so I couldn’t care less what people’ s opinions are or what they’re about. Nobody gets paid to care!,’ blasted Quillin about the flak he faced for giving up his belt. ‘It’s about being challenged, you’ll be challenged for all different decisions that you make – [decisions] that I made in my life and I think that applies to anybody else. The American has a 71 per cent knockout ratio, but he is keeping his feet on the ground ahead of the fight . ‘I just worry about myself, keep good thoughts and a positive mind and keep a great mindset for myself and that I’m just focused.’ Quillin’s first son, Joaquin, was born last August, at the same time his close uncle, Eric Munson, battled pancreatic cancer, losing his fight just two months ago. He has been out of the ring for 12 months since his last title defence. Has he been able to shake the ring rust and the emotional baggage? ‘Everything is a challenge in life. I was always in the gym, but I was dealing with mental stuff and I’m glad I overcame those things. ‘Now I’m back to where I need to be at,’ answered Quillin. ‘Testament to that is when I step into the ring with Andy Lee on April 11. I challenge myself to overcome these things. ‘My uncle’s in his casket and gone now so I got a closing period, a one on one with my uncle before he passed. ‘I left him in Grand Rapids (Michigan) on February 2 and he passed three days after. It was like a rough thing, but I had my closing period where I accepted that the fate of God is going to be what it is and I didn’t have no control over that. I just learned some powerful things – that I need to accomplish as much as I can while I’m living so that I don’t have regrets when it’s my time. ‘Now I’m just looking forward and Andy Lee is who’s in front of me right now.’ Moving on seems to be a regular feature of Quillin’s life. Next week’s fight with Lee will take place in the challenger’s adopted home town, but to call Quillin one of ‘Brooklyn’s Own’ is to ignore his path. Born in Chicago, but raised in Grand Rapids, only his ‘Kid Chocolate’ nickname hints at his pedigree. Quillin, who will fight Andy Lee next week, says it will be a big test against the Irish fighter . He was christened with the alias owing to his physical resemblance to the legendary Cuban featherweight champion of the same ring name, but Quillin also has a blood connection to the Caribbean island as his father was born there before defecting to the US. ‘I went there in 2009 and spent two-and-a-half weeks there and it was one of the best times. I got to learn about life and experience, something different other than what I’m used to,’ says Quillin on his pilgrimage to Cuba. ‘Living in the United States all your life, you go out to another country and you assume you know everything until you see other people living a certain way. ‘I had to recheck myself and say I’m not somebody that knows everything … I found out that it’s not really about the money, it’s about your family. ‘My father left Cuba and met my mom in Chicago – my mom’s an African black lady. My mom spoke nothing but English and my dad spoke nothing but Spanish, but my dad learned English from my mom and my mom learned Spanish from my father. ‘My father knew the original Kid Chocolate in Cuba, but he’s no relation. It’s part of my destiny that I was named Kid Chocolate by other people. Quillin has been away from the ring for a while, but is now ready to recapture his title against Lee . ‘I knew I had a big responsibility when it came to taking on the name. It’s a great part of my story to inherit a name like that and fight for the legacy of a fellow Cuban.’ Undefeated in 31 fights with 22 knockouts, Quillin is doing his best to uphold that honour but critics have suggested that he has not always taken on the best opponent available. He has defeated some big names, including an old Ronald ‘Winky’ Wright, while his stoppage wins over tough contenders were impressive and his title win over N’Dam (Lee’s opponent at the 2004 Athens Olympic Games) proved his world-class ability. But Lee is arguably his most testing opponent to date. Quillin is reluctant to compare their respective levels of opposition, however. ‘Andy Lee is just going to be one of those tests for me to go out and challenge [myself]. ‘For me to criticise other people’s performances, that’s not what I came in the game for, I came in the game to be a fighter and worry about fighting. ‘I gave Andy nothing but respect for accomplishing what a lot of people didn’t get to do, which is become a champion so I look at him like a champion and a guy that has never took a loss. ‘You got to realise that Andy is who he is now and Andy today might be different from the Andy that was [around] yesterday or in the future, you never know. ‘We just prepare and train hard to make sure we’re able to learn [about] people right there in that ring and focus on that. ‘You just have to accept sometimes that people try to be great like other people and never become great, but if you’re able to take what you already have and work with those things you become great.’ His words read as a tasty recipe to become a champion.",American boxer out to take back his title from Limerick fighter .
1656,"The alleged racial profiling of suspects by police hit the headlines against last week following the fatal shooting of an unarmed, black father-of-four  during a routine traffic stop in South Carolina. But now, a young African-American man has released a video disputing claims that all white police officers treat suspects 'on the basis of their color', insisting that 'there are good cops out there'. In the footage, which has gone viral on social media, Will Stack, a 22-year-old U.S. Army National Guardsman, recounts his own experience with a 'Caucasian officer' in the state's Lexington County. He explains how he was pulling out of Lexington County Courthouse on Wednesday, to make a left turn, when he decided to use the empty median lane to access the left turn lane, which was full. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . 'Just because you're a cop doesn't mean you're bad': Will Stack, 22, a U.S. Army National Guardsman, has released a video (pictured) disputing claims that all white officers treat suspects 'on the basis of their color' Moments later, he was stopped by the cop for 'improper use of the median'. 'He told me what I did, asked for my license and registration, I gave that to him,' Mr Stack says in the selfie-style video. He continues: 'Now, I will say that why he was here with me, I made sure my hands were on the steering wheel, I made sure to speak very politely as I always do. I did what he told me to do. 'I handed him the information and I sat here and waited and turned my music down.' The officer left Mr Stack's car for a few minutes, before walking back and returning the documents to him. He then explained the proper use of the median to Mr Stack, telling him it 'needs to be open for emergency vehicles'. 'I was in the wrong, I didn't realize it. I did it out of habit,' Mr Stack admits. After acknowledging the officer's words, Mr Stack, a former Psychology student at the University of South Carolina, was given a warning and both him and the cop went their respective ways. In the video,  filmed minutes after the encounter and later posted on Mr Stack's Facebook page, where it has been viewed 1.7million times, Mr Stack goes on to explain why he is telling his story. Traffic stop: In the footage, which has gone viral on social media, Mr Stack recounts his own experience with a 'Caucasian officer' in South Carolina. He says he was given a warning after doing everything the cop said . Praise: Over the past few days, thousands of Facebook users have commented (above) on Mr Stack's selfie-style video, with many praising him for his honesty amid a national scandal over alleged police brutality . Mixed opinion: Although many of the users' comments were positive, others were negative (as seen bottom) 'The point of this is to say that I am an African-American male, this gentleman was Caucasian. There were no problems. He did his job, I did what I was supposed to do, and that was it,' he says. 'I feel like people need to understand that not all officers are crooked, not all officers are racist, bad people, and not all people who get shot or Tasered or arrested by officers are innocent victims. 'Just because you're black doesn't mean you're a victim, just because you're white doesn't mean you're a racist, just because you're a cop doesn't mean you're a bad person.' He adds: 'This world really needs to stop putting labels on people and things and see them as who they are: people doing things. Ignorance has no color. God doesn't see color. Why should we?' Mr Stack captured the video just days after North Charleston officer Michael Slager was arrested for murder for allegedly shooting Water Scott, 50, five times in the back as he was running away.

He told WIS that although he had concerns over the use of force  applied by Officer Slager, 33, he was keeping an open mind about the shooting - and did not believe Scott should have tried to flee. Speaking to the station, Mr Stack, who recently completed a deployment with the National Guard and is now job hunting, said: ' It's possible for African Americans and police officers to get along. 'And, not everybody shares the same mindset because nobody's the same, everybody's different.' Over the past few days, thousands of Facebook users have commented on Mr Stack's video, with many praising him for his honesty amid the national scandal over alleged police brutality.

Football hero: Jon Hamm the year he graduated from John Burroughs School in Ladue, Missouri and one year before his admission to University of Texas at Austin . Partners: Jon Hamm and Jennifer Westfeldt attended the ""Girls"" season four series premiere after party at The Museum of Natural History on January 5, 2015 in New York City. Sanders subsequently withdrew from the university and sought counselling to cope with the shameful episode which resulted in a police inquiry and the fraternity chapter being disbanded. Hamm, a sophomore, was identified as a ringleader and arrested in 1993, long before he became one of America's most recognizable actors playing boozy advertising exec Don Draper. An assault charge was dismissed, however, and he completed a period of probation instead of receiving a conviction for hazing. Our exclusive photos show Sanders in his senior year at Richland High School in North Richland Hills, Texas where he excelled in his studies, played for the basketball team and was treasurer of the school council. Despite his ordeal at UT he was able to resume his education at Texas Christian University, before going to further institutions to study both law and medicine. The 45-year-old lives now with his wife Anada, 41, and their two children in Fort Worth, where he works both as a doctor and an attorney specializing in medical malpractice and personal injury. He has declined to speak publicly about his ordeal but the harrowing details are laid bare in court documents dating back more than two decades. In a 1991 interview transcript obtained by Daily Mail Online, Sanders tells investigators with the Travis County's Attorney's Office how he suffered 'repeated beatings and assaults' at the hands of Sigma Nu 'actives'. He also alleged that he and his fellow pledges were subjected to 'repeated confinements' in a series of tiny compartments carved into the frat building's foundations - including 'the pit', 'the hole' and 'the grave'. Sanders listed Hamm as one of his chief tormentors, recalling how the future star ordered him to recite a six-page list of phrases pledges are told to memorize called the 'bulls*** list' When Sanders forgot the last of Hamm's nicknames, which included MC Hammer and Young Bobby, he recalled how Hamm got ""mad, I mean really mad' Sanders told officials the worst of the hazing happened in the early hours of November 10, 1990 when he was summoned to the house and warned by Hamm: 'It’s going to be a long night.' The junior was then allegedly subjected to two hours of brutal physical attacks as part of his fiery baptism into the fraternity.

He listed Hamm as one of his chief tormentors, recalling how the future star ordered him to recite a six-page list of phrases pledges are told to memorize called the 'bulls*** list'. When he forgot the last of Hamm's nicknames, which included MC Hammer and Young Bobby, he recalled how Hamm got ""mad, I mean really mad'. Hamm and his frat cohorts' retribution was to spank Sanders repeatedly with a paddle. 'I'm hurting bad, I mean being hit right where the kidney is, it's killing me,' Sanders told his interviewers. Hamm and another fraternity member then lifted Sanders up by his underwear, pulling it back and forth in a sawing motion. 'I don't know how far underwear stretches, I don't know how far I was off the ground,' he recalled. 'I was hurting really bad and I remember I was looking up at the ceiling and I was gritting my teeth and squinting my eyes ... it was sawing and it was hurting.' Sanders told investigators how Hamm then led him to 'the pit' where he ordered him to do press-ups and pushed his face into the ground. The distraught pledge felt someone, possibly Hamm, standing on his back. Hamm is then supposed to have set fire to Sanders' pants and refused to let him pat the flames down, instead making him blow them out. Finally he was led upstairs to the 'party room' when Hamm hooked the claw of a hammer underneath his testicles and pulled him around the room 'for at least a minute'. Suave Don Draper has had to his own dark past on the hit show Mad Men. But for Jon Hamm, 'The hazing incident was an isolated incident,' said a friend .

In the wake of the hazing, Sanders fled to a friend's room to escape further brutality before eventually showing his bruises to fellow students. He later claimed to have suffered nerve damage to his ribs, kidney spasms and a lineal spinal fracture . Sanders' horrified mother Margaret reported it to UT authorities, triggering a police investigation and prompting the fraternity to permanently close its UT chapter. University records show Hamm, now aged 44, left the college at the end of the semester without a degree and returned to his hometown in Missouri. Sanders later launched a lawsuit against Sigma Nu seeking 'unspecified actual and exemplary damages for willful and wanton misconduct'. It was dismissed with the agreement of both parties, however, in 1993, possibly signalling that an out-of-court settlement had been reached. That same year Hamm was arrested by the Austin Police Department but court documents show that in 1995 he received deferred adjudication, allowing him to avoid a criminal conviction by serving a period of probation. His hazing shame went unreported for two decades until Star magazine broke the story last week in the midst of the final Mad Men season airing on AMC. Hamm is yet to comment but a friend told Star: 'The hazing incident was an isolated incident in Jon's life. Since then, he's been strong enough to take steps to make himself a better person.' Shame: The allegedly assault saw Hamm and seven other frat brothers set fire to the pledge and beat him with a paddle . Early career: Jon Hamm is pictured here on the 1996 show The Big Date - one year after he had his arrest warrant dismissed and six years after the alleged hazing incident . Three Sigma Nu members also pleaded no contest to charges of hazing, a misdemeanor, and were ordered to serve 15 to 30 days in jail. They were subsequently allowed to complete a community service or work-release program instead. Another member was convicted of a lesser hazing violation and fined $500. Sander's attorney, Bill Whitehurst, did not return calls asking for comment. A warrant was issued for Hamm's arrest in 1992 but the actor reached a plea deal with authorities in 1995 and the charges were dismissed. He returned home to live with his family in Missouri and the actor - who recently emerged from a 30-day stint in a rehab facility - began his acting career. A friend told Star that although shocking, 'The hazing incident was an isolated incident in Jon's life. Since then, he's been strong enough to take steps to make himself a better person.'

Mixing with the stars: John and Claire with singer Stephen Gately at a charity ball in May 2009, just five months before the Boyzone singer was found dead at his holiday apartment in Majorca . Historic: Broughton Hall in Staffordshire was the scene of a Civil War tragedy according to Mr Caudwell . The English Civil War took place between 1642 and 1651. It was fought by the Cavaliers - who remained loyal to King Charles I - and the Roundheads, who wanted to overthrow the monarchy. Their battles saw Charles I being executed, his son, Charles II, being exiled and Oliver Cromwell taking over as the leader of a republic Britain in 1649. Cromwell died in 1958 from suspected septicemia - and he was buried with great pomp at Westminster Abbey. But in 1661, a year after the monarchy was restored, his body was exhumed and subjected to a 'posthumous execution'. Mr Caudwell, who is ranked as the 42nd richest person in Britain, bought Broughton Hall 20 years ago for £800,000. The house and its 28-acres, which are near Eccleshall, are now worth more than £10million. The businessman started work at the age of 17 on the production line of the Michelin factory in his home city, Stoke-on-Trent, for just £3 a week. He began his mobile-phone empire in 1987. Earlier this month he spent £155million buying the Audley Street garage in Mayfair, central London. He plans to knock it down and build a high-end housing complex worth as much as £2billion. The apartment block will contain five townhouses, three penthouses, a mews home and 21 luxury flats - rivalling properties such as the nearby One Hyde Park for the title of the world's most desirable living space.

He has lived there for 20 years after making his money from the mobile-phone company Phones4U. A half-sized locomotive will haul a fleet of fully furnished carriages, at an initial cost of £500,000. Mr Caudwell said at the time: 'It's a mad idea - crackpot really. I'll probably only use the railway two or three times a year but I've had a fascination with steam trains since I was a boy.' No doubt they will be enjoyed by his family of five children by three women. He split from his last long-term partner, Claire Johnson, last year. The couple had been together for 15 years and remain friends. Mr Caudwell is also friends with his former wife Kate, to whom he was married for 25 years.
