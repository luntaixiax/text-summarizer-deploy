11123,"A British-born businessman has been placed on the FBI's Most Wanted list over claims he conducted a multi-million pound luxury car scam. Afzal Khan is accused of conning a string of customers and financial firms at a motor dealership he ran in the US. Federal agents hunting the 32-year-old, originally from Edinburgh, fear he may have fled the country and have offered a $20,000 reward for information leading to his arrest. Afzal Khan (pictured) is accused of conning a string of customers and financial firms at a motor dealership he ran in the US . Federal agents hunting the 32-year-old, originally from Edinburgh, fear he may have fled the country and have offered a $20,000 reward for information leading to his arrest . Khan is accused of obtaining loans from a bank for cars that he never delivered, but for which the purchaser was still responsible . Flamboyant Khan, known to his clients as 'Bobby', opened the Emporio Motor Group in New Jersey in 2013 and maintained a high profile. He appeared on US reality series The Real Housewives Of New Jersey and counted members of the show's cast among his clients. He has now been accused of a massive fraud involving super cars including Lamborghinis, Bentleys and Rolls Royces. He is accused of obtaining loans from a bank for cars that he never delivered, but for which the purchaser was still responsible. He also obtained loans for cars that were delivered, but for which neither he nor Emporio had title documents. As a result, the purchasers of these cars were liable for the loan, but could not register the vehicles. Khan also offered to sell cars for customers, and then neither returned the cars nor provided any money from car sales. Flamboyant Khan, known to his clients as 'Bobby', opened the Emporio Motor Group in New Jersey in 2013 and maintained a high profile . One financial institution is said to have lost $1.6million from its dealings with Khan and 75 customers have come forward to make complaints against him. If convicted, he could face a maximum potential penalty of 20 years in prison and a multi-million dollar fine. Khan was born in Edinburgh to Pakistani parents and moved to America more than 20 years ago. Police and the FBI attempted to arrest him at his New Jersey home at the end of October but could not locate him. He has now been placed on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted 'white collar criminals' list. In an interview he gave when he opened his car dealership in 2013, Khan boasted that he had been selling luxury cars since he was 18 . He said: 'There's a waiting list for any car like this, because you can't find it, but the number of millionaires and billionaires grows every day. 'Everybody wants the next toy. This is a boutique dealership. It's like walking into a Gucci or a Fendi store.' The FBI wanted poster for Khan says he has ties to the United Arab Emirates, Canada, the UK and Pakistan, and may be found in those countries. He is described as 5 feet 10 inches and 180 pounds, with a scar on his right arm. Last week, Khan's brother Anil Iqbal was arrested by police in New Jersey investigating the alleged scam. Iqbal, 36, who was an employee at the dealership, has been charged with conspiracy to commit theft, theft by extortion, theft by deception and fencing. An FBI spokesman said: 'Afzal Khan is wanted for allegedly defrauding customers and financial institutions while he was the owner of Emporio Motor Group, a car dealership in Ramsey, New Jersey. 'From approximately December 2013 to September 2014, Khan allegedly obtained loans for vehicles that were never delivered, obtained loans for vehicles without proper title, and issued insufficient funds checks. 'Khan also allegedly offered to sell vehicles on consignment and then neither returned the vehicles nor provided any funds for the vehicle sales. 'A federal arrest warrant was issued for Khan on October 21, 2014, by the United States District Court, District of New Jersey, Newark, New Jersey, after he was charged with wire fraud. 'The FBI is offering a reward of up to $20,000 for information leading to the arrest of Afzal Khan.'"
11119,"My teenagers demand something a bit more exciting than sand and sea from family summer holidays nowadays, and given their obsession with all things Kardashian, we decided on California this year. In fact, we plumped for a classic American road trip - driving along the Pacific Coast Highway (aka Route 1) from San Francisco to Los Angeles. It took Molly, Dylan and I three weeks to do it, and we fitted so much in during that time it's difficult to even do it justice. Navigating Route 1 from San Fran's iconic Golden Gate Bridge to LA, Jane Horrocks enjoys her road trip . San Francisco is known as America's most European city, possibly because you'll need to pack a fleece even in late July. The mist that rolls in off the sea and shrouds the Golden Gate Bridge most days can sometimes linger, but we never stayed still long enough to get cold. Based in the funky Hotel Zetta - where the foyer-come games room and bar is plastered with colossal photos of John Lennon and past guests of Alcatraz - we spent three days hurtling around the city, often clinging for dear life to the famous cable cars that haul you up and down the City's hills. We ate clam chowder from a bread bowl at Fisherman's Wharf, we trawled the boutiques of Haight Ashbury in search of the summer of love, we bussed out to the Golden Gate, and we wondered at the aquarium in Golden Gate Park. Jane travelled the scenic route, taking in beaches . And, fleeces on, we took the boat trip to Alcatraz, which is not to be missed. The brilliant audio guide that leads you around the prison is narrated only by men who were once guards or prisoners on the rock, making for an eerie and compelling tour. After trying to distil the city into only 72 hours, we climbed into our SUV and headed for Route 1. It's only about 350 miles as the crow flies between San Francisco and LA, but this (mostly) coastal route is probably well over 500 miles long as it winds through some of California's most wonderful, ever-changing scenery. Much of the highway has a 55mph speed limit and has only one lane in each direction - it's time to take your foot off the gas, relax and take it all in. My children said it reminded them of Dorset as we headed south past Santa Cruz and then nipped briefly into Monterey to dine in a seafront restaurant on the edge of Cannery Row, the waterfront district made famous in John Steinbeck's novel of the same name. At Dylan's insistence, we took a detour on to 17 Mile Drive, the scenic road around the Monterey Peninsula that leads to the world-famous Pebble Beach golf club. He was rather disappointed by the condition of the course there, but thrilled with the state of Quail Lodge and Golf Club, our first port of call just outside the pretty little town of Carmel. Even the non-golfers among us loved our luxurious bungalow at the edge of the course; secluded and tranquil, plush and green with a view of distant mountains. When the sound of silence got too much for us, just across the street at Valley Hills there was the excellent and lively Baja Cantina Mexican restaurant, and a wonderful deli too. Leaving Carmel, you find yourself at the edge of the spectacular area known as Big Sur: wild and often mountainous terrain battling it out with the equally wild Pacific. Dining in Cannery Row, the waterfront district made famous in John Steinbeck's novel of the same name . The road coils up and down cliffs and crosses cavernous gorges for almost 100 miles - incredibly dramatic but sometimes not for the faint-hearted. We stopped off at the Garrapata National Park, in a baking-hot and silent valley, where the crash of the waves was replaced by the hum of insects and the call of the buzzards wheeling overhead. This was a completely different wildness, underlined when Dylan narrowly avoided stepping on a basking rattlesnake. At the end of Big Sur you can encounter yet another type of wildness altogether in the form of the legendary Madonna Inn in San Luis Obispo. Every bedroom is themed here - from Rock Bottom (it's a cave) to Old Mexico and the comparatively muted silver walls and flock wallpaper of our own Crystal Room. To call the Madonna Inn 'kitsch' is to do it a huge disservice, because it takes everything to a whole new level of eye-popping taste. Take the Gold Rush Steakhouse, which puts the shocking into pink. The whole place is furnished and upholstered in this garish shade, softened only by the presence of enormous gold chandeliers. You have to see it to believe it, but the food and service were fantastic. Big Sur: Where the wild and often mountainous terrain battles it out with the equally wild Pacific Ocean . We took a rare detour off Route 1 to the Danish settlement of Solvang, a sort of cutesy yet sinister re-creation of Denmark in the California sun, full of pastry shops and Chinese tourists. A little unnerved by this, we headed back to the safety of the highway and soon found ourselves in Santa Barbara. It's the classic California of posters and T-shirts, with infinitely long palm-lined streets with mountains at one end and the ocean at the other. We stayed at the beach side end of one such thoroughfare in the aptly named Harbor View Inn, and found great seafood at the end of the pier at Stearns Wharf opposite the hotel and at the fantastic Fishhouse just a couple of blocks along Cabrillo Boulevard. Over the rail tracks behind the inn is State Street, where you can find everything from Macy's and American Apparel to tattooists and cavernous bars advertising Punk Rock Bingo. The farmers' market closes the street on a Tuesday afternoon, offering up a Californian cornucopia of fruit, veg and other tasty treats. To the east of State Street is The Funk Zone, an old industrial area that is regenerating itself into a haven of restaurants, art galleries and wine-tasting rooms. Back on the road near San Simeon, you will see exotic animals on either side of the highway. Floundering on the beach are gigantic elephant seals - enormous specimens of blubbery ugliness hooting and honking and generally having a riot at the edge of the sea. Spectacular: An enormous neo-Classical marble swimming pool dominates Hearst's magnificent mansion . On the other side are zebras - direct descendants of the herd that press tycoon William Randolph Hearst installed at the magnificent Hearst Castle, which appears right ahead of you. You can take a tour of the castle and its grounds. After a 15-minute coach drive up the snaking road to the top of the hill, you discover a spectacular mansion furnished with antiques and tapestries from all over Europe, and boasting Roman baths, an enormous neo-Classical marble swimming pool and its own private cinema. In the 1930s, Hearst Castle was party central for Clark Gable, Errol Flynn, Greta Garbo et al. Having soaked up a bit of the Golden Age of Hollywood, we headed off on Route 1 again to see the City of Angels of today. There we stayed at the slick and sleek Viceroy Santa Monica Hotel, choosing the beach-life of Santa Monica and Venice over the urban sprawl of Hollywood or Beverly Hills where the car is king. The body-builders and gymnasts of Muscle Beach and the rollerblading buskers of Venice are highly entertaining, and you can walk everywhere. Hollywood is really an idea rather than a place anyway. It always seems as if it might be just around the next corner but it never is, and the Hollywood sign always stays aloof in the distance. What a beach: Huntington Beach is a pure three-and-a-half miles of uncrowded white sand loved by surfers . We went on an excellent guided tour taking in the Chinese Theatre, Walk of Fame, Rodeo Drive, Sunset Strip and other spots of note. A Sunday trip to Universal Studios was great fun, too, for the rides and a look at a real working film set on its day off. Mind you, the scariest ride of the day was getting on the freeway by accident on the way into LA. Unless you're a professional stunt driver in a hurry, the freeway is probably best avoided in favour of a trundle along the city's more sedate boulevards. We drove the last 40 miles south through the LA suburbs to our final stop at the Huntington Beach Hyatt Regency. And what a beach it is - three-and-a-half miles of uncrowded white sand known as Surf City. It was thrilling to watch the guys surfing along on the waves. Later we watched the sun go down over the pier from the comfort of the superb Duke's Restaurant, before ambling back along a beach glowing with fire-pits and shrouded in barbecue smoke - preparing ourselves for the horrors of donning fleeces again for the journey home.

3734,"In a world where online shopping is king, Toshiba hopes technology can change the in store experience - with a robo-assistant. The firm's humanoid robot is set to start work at the information desk of a department store in Tokyo to help customers find their way around. The female-looking robot, named Aiko Chihira, will only speak Japanese - but she is also capable of sign language. Scroll down for video . Toshiba's humanoid robot known as Aiko Chihira, is set to start work at the information desk of a department store in Tokyo. Chihira in the work outfit created for the robot . However, Chihira is unlikely to engage in smalltalk its makers admit. Instead the robot was created to appear, talk and move as humanly as possible. Chihira blinks, bows and moves its mouth and lips smoothly while speaking. A Toshiba spokesman told the Wall Street Journal that Chihira is programmed with multiple human-like expressions, and that it will offer six-minute guidance to customers with information about the department store including events. Chihira has appeared at exhibitions and events, but this is the first time it will provide customer service. The robot’s appearance wasn’t modeled on any specific person but was designed to give a friendly impression, according to Toshiba. The robot will be set up at the Mitsukoshi department store in Nihonbashi, Tokyo, on Monday and Tuesday. Ms Chihira uses sign language to introduce itself to humans. Toshiba describes the eerie android, which has blinking eyes and a fixed smile, as having the appearance of 'a friendly young woman.' At present, the android can mimic only simple movements, such as exchanging greetings and signing in Japanese. The technology was first shown off at Ceatec 2014 in Japan. One of the most popular devices there was TE Connectivity's dinosaur robot, the TE Saurus, which lets users experience a close encounter with a 6ft 11 (2.1 metre-tall) reptile droid. A smartphone application makeS the dinosaur walk or jump, while a shake of the smartphone prompts the TE Saurus to bark. TE Saurus can also play trivia games as users answer questions through the app. Another highlight is Omron's three-legged robot, which is capable of playing a relaxed game of ping pong. It watches its human opponent to predict the ball's path, and can even decide to take it easy on opponents by missing a few hits. The robot’s appearance wasn’t modeled on any specific person but was designed to give a friendly impression, according to Toshiba. With five motors to control paddle movement, it is programmed to serve the ball in a way that makes it easy for the player to return. 'This ping pong robot is really a demonstration of how a robot can interact with a person and react in an appropriate manner,' said Takuya Tsuyuguchi, an Omron manager. 'We envision this robot perhaps being used in a factory or production line and having a role in which it would have to interact with a worker to do or build something. 'This would involve the robot understanding the needs of its human counterpart and behaving appropriately.'

But the company soon hopes to integrate its technologies in areas including sensing, speech synthesis, speech recognition and robotic control to create a more social robot by 2020. The goal is to design a companion for the elderly and people with dementia, to offer telecounselling in natural speech, communicate through sign language, and allow healthcare to keep an eye on elderly people. Weebles may seem like basic toys now, but in their day they used an impressive weight system based on the laws of physics to ‘wobble but never fall down.’ To bring this childhood toy into the modern-day, a Japanese firm has created a troop of Weeble-style robotic cheerleaders who dance and move while balancing on a ball. And thanks to built-in gyroscopes and infrared sensors, the robots perform in perfect synchronicity - but never fall over. The Murata Cheerleaders were built by Murata Manufacturing. Instead of wheels, the cheerleading robots balance on a removable ball, which rolls in its housing to help the machines dance and move. They remain upright due to three advanced gyro sensors, which incorporate inverted-pendulum control technology, to detect tilt angles. Similar gyro sensors are commonly used in digital cameras, car navigation systems, and more recently, the electronic stability control (ESC) systems that prevent cars from skidding. Each robot is equipped with four infrared sensors, and five ultrasonic microphones to detect surrounding objects, even in the dark. And, based on the differing speeds of sound and light waves, this system determines the relative positions of the robots within a 172 square feet (16 metre square) space. Meanwhile a group of 14-inch (36cm) tall cheerleader robots showcased their flawless choreography. Murata manufacturing, an electronic component manufacturer, presented the cheerleaders with colour-changing pom-poms that use gyroscopic sensors to roll on spherical bases in unison without losing their balance. 'These robots use our proprietary balancing technology combined with technology that prevents, in real time, the robots from clashing together,' said Tomoyuki Mori, a Murata engineer.

5705,"A hoard of silver coins worth £34million that was sunk by the Nazis on board a steamship has been salvaged by a British-led team at a record depth of 5,150m (17,000ft). The SS City of Cairo was travelling from Bombay to England in 1942 when it was torpedoed by a U-boat 480 miles south of St Helena, taking 100 tons of rupees with it to the bottom of the ocean. It was long assumed that the vessel's cargo, belonging to the UK Treasury, would be lost forever such was the complexity of the task facing salvage experts. Treasure trove: Some of the 100 tons of rupees found buried in the ocean floor at a record depth of 17,000ft after the cargo ship they were being transported on was sunk by a Nazi submarine during World War Two . Record find: Some coins are raised to the surface during a pioneering recovery project by a British-led team . Hidden: The City of Cairo was finally discovered (above) 'broken in two and buried deep in the seafloor silt' Underwater company Deep Ocean Search used powerful sonar to locate the vessel on the sea floor . That was until a team led by British expert John Kingsford used pioneering techniques to track down the ship with powerful sonar and robotics. Underwater company Deep Ocean Search (DOS), which included 20 French oceanographers, was then contracted by the UK Ministry of Transport to recover the coins from a record depth of 17,000ft - some 4,500ft deeper than the Titanic. A spokesman for DOS said: 'This was to be a difficult search as the water depth would exceed 5,000m, the weather, swell and currents were known to be challenging and the presumed site was some 1,000 miles from the nearest land in the foothills of the mid-Atlantic ridge.' When the ship was finally discovered,  it was 'broken in two and buried deep in the seafloor silt', adding that 'parts of the ship had metres of mud heaped upon it.' The SS City of Cairo was sunk en route from Bombay to India, via Cape Town and Recife in Brazil . The rupees, belonging to the UK Treasury, were being transported from India to England when the ship sunk . Underwater company Deep Ocean Search, which included 20 French oceanographers, was contracted by the UK Ministry of Transport to recover the coins from a record depth of 17,000ft - 4,500ft deeper than the Titanic . Keeping it under wraps: The recovery took place in 2013, but has only now been made public . The SS City of Cairo was travelling from Bombay to England, via Cape Town and Recife, Brazil, when it was attacked by a Nazi U-Boat on November 6, 1942. The U-68 hit the vessel with one torpedo, but waited a further 20 minutes before firing the second. That crucial delay gave 296 of the ship's 302 passengers and crew time to escape in lifeboats. Famously, the German captain, Karl-Friedrich Merten, approached the lifeboats and told the survivors: 'Goodnight, sorry for sinking you.' The victims were eventually rescued three weeks later, but 104 had died. Maeva Onda, one of the oceanographers on board the salvage ship, SV John Lethbridge, said the search submarine was successful on its first dive. 'After two hours of underwater descent, the robot transmitted the first images of the wreck. It was incredible,' she told Le Figaro, as cited by the Daily Telegraph. The find was confirmed when the robot brought up coins stamped with the Crown. But the team suffered 'serious' problems trying to recover the bulk of the hoard because of the depths involved. The spokesman for DOS said: 'The team quickly found that operating at this depth caused serious technical difficulties which were new to us and which had to be resolved, quickly. 'The combination of pressure, temperature, repeated dives at this depth and other issues resulted in multiple breakdowns of systems such as we had not experienced before when working in 3000m to 4000m depths.' The recovery took place in 2013, but has only now been made public. DOS has left a plaque commemorating their find on the sea bed. Maeva Onda, one of the oceanographers on board the salvage ship, SV John Lethbridge, said the search submarine was successful on its first dive, adding: 'It was incredible'"
7089,"Second homeowners face being hit with double rates of council tax under Lib Dem plans to protect rural life. Nick Clegg said wealthy people with holiday homes would not mind having to 'chip in a bit' to protect services in areas where as many as one in 10 homes are vacant for much of the year. The well-off buying up homes in tourist hotspots has also driven up property values, leaving local people priced out of the areas where they grew up. Nick Clegg - steps off a fishing boat as he visits Newlyn Harbour, near Penzance, Cornwall today - said wealthy people with holiday homes would not mind having to 'chip in a bit' to protect services in areas where as many as one in 10 homes are vacant for much of the year . Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg holds a cod at the Newlyn Fish Market in Cornwall this morning after unveiling his plan to save popular rural areas from the blight of second home owners . Under the Lib Dem plan, launched in Cornwall today, local authorities would have the power to charge 200 per cent council tax. The levy would be used in part to deter people from buying holiday homes in the first place, but the money generated could be used to support schools, post officers and other services which can become unviable without sufficient permanent residents. The double council tax would not be compulsory, but councils in areas like Cumbria, Cornwall and Devon have said they would be interested in the idea to 'discourage' second home ownership. On a campaign visit in St Austell, Cornwall, Mr Clegg said the move could help 'particularly in such a wonderful part of the country as this where there are so many people with second homes and where the prices because of that are way beyond the reach of many young people wanting to get their feet on the first rung of the property ladder'. The Lib Dem leader even claimed second home-owners would 'like to chip in a bit extra' to fund the communities in which they they spend their holidays. Mr Clegg, who visited Newlyn fish market and harbour with St Ives candidate Andrew George as he launched his countryside charter, told ITV News: 'It is giving councils the freedom to raise a bit of money from those who holiday in a community but don't live in a community all year round so that local public services can be properly supported for those people who do live in their community all year round. 'That seems to me to be fair and, I have to say to you, I suspect people who own second homes here - many of whom have significant means - would like to chip in a bit extra so that they know that, even though they are not living in a community all the time, they are nonetheless supporting the local services that local people do rely upon.' Under the Lib Dem plan, launched in Cornwall today, local authorities would have the power to charge 200 per cent council tax . The Deputy PM and Lib Dem MP Andrew George pose for a photograph at Newlyn Harbour  near Penzance . Mr Clegg, who has been warned his party faces near-wipeout in its Westcountry stronghold, said he wants to 'play on the conscience' of second homeowners. He said they needed to realise that local people were being priced out of the property market and it was not in their interest for the rural community to 'wither on the vine'. He told reporters that the levy was not aimed at stopping people buying a holiday property. Mr Clegg (right) holds a fish with Newlyn Fish Market manager Lionel Washer (left)  and Harbour Master Rob Parsons (centre) during a visit in Cornwall today . 'What would a fancy second home in Cornwall, what would they pay in council tax, maybe a thousand quid, £1,500? 'I think if that is increased to £2,000 or a bit more, is that going to stop them buying it in the first place? I doubt it. 'Of course I believe in and want to protect people's freedoms to buy holiday homes and second homes. What I want to do is make sure it's a fair deal for those communities where those second homes are located.' He added that many people who had second homes in Cornwall were 'acutely aware that there is this big, burning local issue about the availability of housing for local youngsters'. The measure forms part of a 'countryside charter' being launched by the Lib Dems, with Mr Clegg claiming his party will create 300,000 new jobs in rural areas if it is in government after the General Election on May 7. Mr Clegg promised to 'close the gap' between urban and rural areas in the provision of high speed broadband, ensuring 99.9% of households are covered. Other measures include help for farming, strengthening the powers of the Groceries Code Adjudicator to ensure farmers are paid fairly, publishing a national food strategy, and developing an animal disease strategy to lessen the risks and costs of animal disease. The party says it will also take action to protect rural post offices and other essential services from closure, prioritise rural housing and boost tourism by introducing a 'fuller' right to roam."
5471,"The three daughters of a New York SUV driver involved in a train wreck that claimed six lives claim that their mother 'is not a murderer'. The defense from the daughters comes nearly two months after their mother Ellen Brody was killed along with five passengers when a train crashed into her SUV on the tracks at a railroad crossing in the Westchester County town of Valhalla. Though the cause of the collision remains unknown, Danielle, Julia and Alexa Brody say that their mother has been criticized and that people have jumped to conclusions about what happened. Scroll down for video . Ellen Brody's (second from right) three daughters, Alexa (left), Danielle (second from left) and Julia (right) Brody, have spoken out to say that their mother is not a murderer and that it was an accident that she drove on to the tracks . Ellen Brody was killed along with five passengers when a train crashed into her SUV on the tracks at a railroad crossing in early February. Her car had gotten stuck between the railroad crossings and instead of reversing she drove on to the tracks . Visit NBCNews.com for breaking news, world news, and news about the economy . 'I went on Google, and I searched my mom's name and I was just reading the comments,' Julia told NBC's Matt Lauer. 'And just the fact that people are like, 'You know, I don't even feel bad for her. How could she possibly do that?'' Julia went on to admit that she first thought that a driver had intentionally driven on to the tracks, before she knew her mother was driving. 'So I was like, ""Why? Why? Why would this woman do that?'"" When we were watching that, though, when he described the woman, I was like, ""That could've been Mommy."" And my sisters were just like, ""Julia, no,""' she said. According to investigators' preliminary findings,  Brody's car was in the danger zone inside railroad crossing gates for about half a minute before the train hit. Brody got ahead of the crossing gate in inching traffic, then got out of her car to examine it after the gate came down and hit the back of it, a witness has said. Nearly two months after the crash Alexa (left), Julia (center) and Danielle (right) Brody told Matt Lauer that people are still jumping to conclusions about what happened . The cause of the collision remains unknown and Brody's daughters remain adamant that their mother never meant to hurt anyone . But then she got back in, seeming unhurried, and advanced onto the track, the witness told news outlets and investigators. The train's engineer also told investigators that he saw the Mercedes SUV moving onto the tracks. But her daughters are adamant that their mother wouldn't have meant to hurt anyone. 'I know who my mom was,' Alexa told NBC. 'I know that she would never, never intentionally hurt people.' 'A lot of times people just want to find a reason,' Danielle added. 'It's just not true. It was an accident.' And Julia put it simply: 'She's not a murderer,' she said. Julia (second from left), Danielle (center) and Alexa (right), pictured with their mother Ellen (left) and father Alan Brody (second from right),  say when they Google their mother's name, they see that commenters have been criticizing their mother . Alexa said that her mother was her best friend and that she would think of her every time she smiled. Trains hit cars on the tracks many times a year, but such crashes rarely kill train riders. Investigators emphasized in February that they want to figure out why this one did, becoming the deadliest accident in the 32-year history of one of the nation's busiest commuter railroads. Investigators looked for any elements that may have intensified the fire, which they believe was ignited by the SUV's gas tank. The NTSB has examined such factors as the adequacy of emergency exits, the train cars and the unusual design of the Metro-North line's third rail. There is no barrier at the crossing between the street and the tracks where the crash occurred. MTA is considering all possible safety enhancements that would prevent deadly accidents in the future, the company's chairman said."
2140,"The slain editor of Charlie Hebdo has slammed his left-wing critics from beyond the grave for criticising publication of drawings of Mohammad. In a book Stéphane Charbonnier, known as Charb, finished just two days before being murdered by jihadist gunmen he argued that left-leaning intellectuals who denounced the cartoons in the satirical magazine were ‘ridiculous demagogues’ for doing so. In the short book, extracts of which are to be published today in weekly magazine L'Obs, he writes: ‘The suggestion that you can laugh at everything, except certain aspects of Islam, because Muslims are much more susceptible than the rest of the population, what is that, if not discrimination? In a book Stéphane Charbonnier (pictured), known as Charb, finished just two days before being mowed down by jihadist gunmen he argued that left-leaning intellectuals who denounced the cartoons in the satirical magazine were ‘ridiculous demagogues’ Journalists hold placards reading 'I am Charlie' as they hold a minute of silence on January 7 following the attack by gunmen in the offices of Charlie Hebdo . ‘It's time to finish with this disgusting paternalism of the white, left-wing bourgeois intellectual seeking to prove himself among the “poor unfortunate undereducated”.’ The book, Lettre Ouverte aux Escrocs de l'Islamophobie qui Font le Jeu des Racistes (Open Letter to the Fraudsters of Islamophobia who Play into Racists' Hands), which may well rock the 'Je Suis Charlie' solidarity over the massacre, argues that some intellectuals who condemned the drawings were merely attention-seekers. It says: ‘Since I am educated, I understand that Charlie Hebdo is using humour. But out of respect for you [Muslims], since you haven't yet discovered second-degree humour, I will denounce these Islamophobic drawings that I pretend not to understand. I will put myself at your level to show that I love you. ‘These ridiculous demagogues just have a huge need to be the centre of attention and want to satisfy their formidable fantasy to dominate others.’ Charb asks why Islamophobia, which technically means ‘fear of Islam’, is being used by activists, media and politicians to denounce hatred of Muslims and wonders why ‘Muslimophobia’ is not used instead, or simply ‘racism’. He argues that ‘a lot of those who campaign against Islamophobia don't actually do it to defend Muslims as individuals, but to defend Prophet Mohammad's religion’. Charlie Hebdo’s satirical attacks on Islam drove two brothers, Cherif and Said Kouachi (pictured) to mount a deadly attack on its office in Paris . Charb also takes a pop at religion, and particularly at believers. ‘The problem is not the Koran or the Bible - sleep-inducing, incoherent and badly written novels - but the faithful who read the Koran or the Bible like you read assembly instructions for Ikea shelves,’ he writes. He condemns those who are ready to ‘cut the infidel's throats along the dotted line otherwise God will deprive me of Club Med in the afterlife’, according to the Daily Telegraph. He blames the media for helping popularise the term ‘Islamophobia’ because ‘any scandal that contains the word Islam in its title sells.’ ‘A terrorist is scary, but if you add that he's an Islamist, everyone wets themselves.’ And he also takes a dig at politicians whom he accuses of seeing Muslims where they should see regular citizens, and wanting to pander to a ‘Muslim electorate’. ‘That's saying that the majority of Muslims don't decide their vote according to the candidates' political ideas but according to the degree of sympathy they display towards Muslims,’ he argues. Charb also defends Charlie Hebdo's controversial depictions of the prophet and extremism over the years, which earned it accusations of Islamophobia. Chillingly, he refers to Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula's Inspire magazine which in 2013 published a list of 11 people accused of ‘crimes against Islam’ and wanted ‘dead or alive’. ‘I find my name, badly spelled but accompanied by a photo where you can recognise my alarmed face’ -- a picture he said was taken when the offices of the magazine were burnt down in 2011 shortly after a special edition was published under the title Charia Hebdo. ‘The skillful montage is titled “YES WE CAN” and below you can read: “a bullet a day keeps the infidel away”.’ Charlie Hebdo’s satirical attacks on Islam drove two brothers, Cherif and Said Kouachi to mount a deadly attack on its office in Paris. They burst into an editorial meeting on January 7, peppering Charb and nine other cartoonists with bullets before calmly leaving. They also shot dead a maintenance worker and a policeman who tried to stop them."
6736,"ISIS has launched English-language radio news bulletins on its Iraqi broadcast service - complete with information on the latest suicide bombings and 'martyrdom operations'. The extremist group's first English bulletin aired on Tuesday on its al-Bayan radio network, which already boasts updates in both Arabic and Russian. The nine-and-a-half minute broadcast, which begins and ends with traditional sounding Arabic music, is hosted by a man with an American accent, who takes the listener through the main events of the day. Round up: The broadcast, hosted by a man with an American accent, boasted of ISIS victories during the day. Pictured: Fighting in Yarmouk was high on the agenda of the radio broadcast . It provided an overview of the militants activities in Iraq, Syria and Libya, discussing a range of topics  - including the alleged death of an ISIS commander in the Yarmouk refugee camp in the Syrian capital, Damascus, a suicide bombing in the Iraqi city of Kirkuk and mortar attacks on militias in Sirte, Libya. It also boasts of ISIS fighters 'roasting the flesh' of their opponents, car bombs killing people and destroying an 'idol' and so-called 'martyrdom operations'. It ends thanking the listener for 'tuning in'. But the radio station is not the only option ISIS commanders are using to reach out to English-speakers: they already have a monthly propaganda magazine, Dabiq. The magazine - named after the Syrian town where a 'malahim', the equivalent to an Armageddon, in which the Muslims ultimately prevail - has so far issued eight editions, covering events like those in Paris and Sydney. It also boasts about some of its worst atrocities in the pages of the glossy booklet - which has even outlined a religious justification for slavery. Dominance?: Is the latest English medium to be used by ISIS - they already have an English magazine . Exactly why ISIS commanders have decided to branch out from print to radio now is not known, but it comes within days of it being revealed a new school of nursing in the militants' de facto capital Raqqa would only accept English-speaking applicants. Students graduating from ISIS' nursing school will be required to spend a full two years working for institutions run by the terrorist organisation after they finish training. However, English's dominance around the globe is likely to mean it is the most convenient language to use when communicating with the estimated 20,000 fighters from 90 countries around the globe who have joined ISIS."
1431,"A Ferrari-driving fantasist dubbed 'Teflon Don' who murdered his wealthy heiress lover in order to steal £816,000 from her bank accounts has been ordered to pay back just £1. Donald Graham, 62, from Sparty Lea, Northumberland, killed heiress and property developer Janet Brown, 45, so he could fund his lavish taste in supercars and buy his second mistress a home. Ms Brown vanished in 2005 and her body has never been found. Scroll down for video . Donald Graham, 62, (pictured) killed heiress and property developer Janet Brown, 45, his lover, for her money . He stole £300,000 of her savings, her Land Rover and Porsche, took her horses and tried to siphon off thousands of pounds from her estate and that of her family. Graham, who dubbed himself Teflon Don, was last year jailed for life with a minimum of 32 years for killing Ms Brown for her money nine years after her death. Prosecutors wanted to reclaim his ill-gotten gains, which they said totalled £816,127.86p, under the Proceeds of Crime Act. But Newcastle Crown Court heard Graham, previously referred to in court as the Prince of Darkness, now has no available assets and so must pay back just back £1. Janet Brown (pictured left) and Graham (right) were lovers for eight years despite Graham being married . Graham, who drove a Ferrari, a Porsche, a Range Rover and a Alfa Romeo Spider, despite allegedly being short of cash, denied murdering Ms Brown between June 14 and 18, 2005 but admitted stealing her money. But jurors, who had been deliberating over the case for a week, found him guilty of murder and perverting the course of justice during a trial last year. The court heard the Hexham heiress 'disappeared from the face of the earth' in June 2005 and no trace of her has ever been found. Graham spun a cruel web of lies that left Ms Brown’s parents believing she was still alive but living abroad. Graham, described as ‘flash’ and always ‘dripping in gold’, lived with his wife Denise, 66, but had two mistresses, including Ms Brown. Graham and Ms Brown,who had saved ‘substantial assets’ of over £400,000, had been together for eight years. He told her that his wife had cancer and when she died they would marry. The Hexham heiress 'disappeared from the face of the earth' in June 2005 and no trace of her has been found . The pair arranged to go on holiday to France in 2005 but at the last minute he pulled out, claiming his wife was unwell, so Miss Brown decided to go alone. The court heard that after booking the holiday, Graham had found a new girlfriend, Elizabeth Todd, 51, with whom he had become infatuated. It was around the day of her intended departure on June 17 that Ms Brown was murdered. Graham had persuaded her to transfer £300,000 into his account and the money dropped just a day before she disappeared. Jurors were told that Graham wanted Miss Brown’s money so he could ‘live a lifestyle that involved owning and driving powerful motor cars’ and buy a property for Todd to live in. During his murder trial at Newcastle Crown Court, the jury heard Ms Brown had been besotted with 'greedy liar' Graham. During his murder trial at Newcastle Crown Court the jury heard Ms Brown had been besotted with 'greedy liar' Graham (pictured in long leather jacket) The trial judge said Ms Brown, whose body has never been found, may have been dumped in a deep pit or mine shaft by former JCB digger driver Graham. Her killer was badly in debt and was struggling to fund the finance agreements on his beloved sports cars. He plundered Ms Brown's bank account to fund his flashy lifestyle, making her elderly parents, Eric and Olive Brown, believe their daughter was still alive by sending them letters and cards in her name from Europe. Graham also ingratiated himself with her parents after her death and started systematically stripping their estate and assets. He used his visits to gain access to Ms Brown's security codes and also sold her Porsche and other cars. When her parents died, he plundered their bank accounts - defrauding a total of more than £500,000 from them. The couple died in 2007 and 2008 respectively, believing their only daughter was working in a bank in Switzerland. After they died building society staff eventually became suspicious that withdrawals were still being made in 2010 and police were called. They believed they were just investigating a fraud but it soon became apparent Ms Brown was missing and a murder inquiry was launched. He hadn't worked since an accident in 1997 when a JCB bucket hit him on the back and he was awarded £40,000 compensation. Graham was jailed for life with a minimum term of 32 years for killing Ms Brown. Northumbria Police subsequently launched an investigation under the Proceeds of Crime Act into his finances. Graham stole more than £800,000 from Ms Brown to fund his love of supercars and a lavish lifestyle . The court heard with his fleet of flash sports cars and his large imposing house on a hill, pony-tailed and goatee-bearded Graham thought of himself as a charmer and cut a distinctive figure in his long leather coat. He liked to play the big man, pretending to be related to murdered Viv Graham who was shot and killed in an unsolved apparent gangland hit in 1993, in an effort to enhance his reputation as a force to be reckoned with. In fact he was a failed former policeman in the Met, having quit after a week in the 1970s, apparently homesick for his native North East. The court heard Graham's main motivation in life was always money and he had a penchant for women over whom he could exert power and control. Graham was jailed for life  for killing Ms Brown. Police are pictured searching for her body in Northumberland ."

Her daughter escaped with minor injuries in the incident on March 31. Police officers of all ranks paid their respects at her funeral at Christ Parish Church in Cyncoed, Cardiff, today, while her hearse was led by four police motorcycles and two police horses. More than a hundred mourners joined police to fill the congregation, where the church's Easter cross was placed outside so personal flowers in memory of Sgt Lucas, who was a Beaver leader, trained rugby referee and Welsh learner, could be laid on it. Her husband Gavin Lucas, 36, walked into the church hand-in-hand with Olivia and their seven-year-old son Lloyd to one of Sgt Lucas's favourite songs - Bette Midler's 'Wind Beneath My Wings' - with the line 'did I ever tell you, you are my hero'. He paid tribute to his late wife saying his love for her would remain in his heart forever and read a poem, which he originally wrote for their wedding day a decade ago but adapted for her funeral. 'A sergeant at work she really did do well. Total dedication to the police, that was our Lou. As you can see today, they will miss her too,' he said. He continued by saying the couple's three children - including 21-year-old Grant - had made their lives complete: 'She will be in our hearts forever, let's try not to be glum,' he read.

He shared with the church tales of their childhood and said Christmas festivities at their home were 'magical'. He said every year she would run into his room to wake him up and as adults she rang at 5am every Christmas morning at their former family home just minutes from the church. 'I never looked forward to that early morning call but I know this year it will be very much missed,' he said. South Wales Police chief constable Peter Vaughan told the congregation and dozens who stood outside listening to a tannoy: 'She was a devoted police officer who was fearless in confronting evil. 'She was inspirational and passionate about people and was a terrific person blessed with physical and moral courage, small in stature but huge in character.' He described her as a 'mother hen' to her officers at Llanishen police station. Superintendent Alun Morgan said: 'Her children, Grant, Olivia and Lloyd, have suffered a loss that those so young should never have to endure. Louise loved her family and her family loved her.' The 41-year-old, who had a love for designer lables and lived her life to the full, was a worshipper at Christ Church where a huge congregation marked her life. Vicar Trystan Hughes said: 'We were privileged in this church to have known her well. She was an enthusiastic and loving member of the congregation here. 'We're privileged to call her and her family our friends. We know, like you, the joy and love that she brought to others. Now many of us are feeling that there's a hole left in our lives where Louise's smile and Louise's laughter used to brighten up our day. 'Today we come with great sadness but also with gratitude for the time we had with Louise and the joy she shared with us. It's fitting that many of you are wearing pink today, as the family asked - Louise would have loved that.' On the way to the crematorium after the service the cortege paused for a brief moment of silence outside the police station in Cardiff where she was a popular community officer before continuing on to a private service at Thornhill Crematorium. Speaking at the time of her death, her eldest son Grant, a police community support officer who gave a reading at today's service,said: 'Mum was the best there is and was simply amazing. I am absolutely well and truly gutted.' Grant said that he wanted to make his mother 'proud' and would help to raise Olive and Lloyd. He added: 'It's mad how my mum and I became much closer over the last couple of weeks and had it all planned out. On behalf of the family, we would like to thank all friends for their support.'
